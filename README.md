# CheatManager
CheatManager is a mobile platform, used for installation/distribution/creation of mobile game cheats/hacks. This platform is completely dynamic and independant because it is led by the community. With CheatManager, you can create your own Game Hacks/Mod Menus/Savegame Editors on your device.
